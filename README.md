# Indian Liver Patient

This project aims on detecting whether the patient's liver is healthy or not based on the values we received from the liver test.

Multiple models like Logistic Regression, K-Neighbors Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier and XGB Classifier have used for classification and from that the model with best accuracy has been selected. Accuracies of these model have been plotted in the bar graph for clear visualization.
